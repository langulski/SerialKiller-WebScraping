## Objectives
This project it's composed by two parts:<br>
- Part01: Obtain data from different sources (using API and/or Web-Scraping) and store it in a database;<br>
- Part02: Build a data visualization using tableau.<br>

### Specific Objective
Build a database and a visualization about serial killers :
>What is  the avg age of a serial killer? <br>
>What are the motives? <br>
>Does abuse early in life have anything related ?<br>

## Motivation
 Serial killers is a trending topic when comes to movies from Hollywood and there are some miss information about serial killers.<br>
This motivated me to search about them and how they operate.<br>


## Serial-Killers
The clound.killer: Killer.Cloud the Serial Killer Database, an ongoing research project which aims to sort and classify serial killers based on documented references from books written about serial killers as well as other online resources listed at the bottom of each killers profile page.<br> 
According to FBI a serial murder is the unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offenders in separate events.<br>
The clound killer have a lot of tables with bool questions, those will be analysed. <br>

## Process
1. Use raw web-scraping to collect data from serial killers around the world and check some stats;<br>

2. Filter the killers that killed more than 1 victim;<br>
3. Clean the data and transform the results;<br>
4. Store the results on my own database;<br>
5. Analyze results on Tableau.<br>

## Learning Process
### Theory applied
- [x] Web Scraping;<br>
- [x] Data Visualization;<br>

### Challenges
- Small sample size;
- Public information may not be accurate;
- Make the subject interesting while avoiding gruesome details.

### New Learnings
- Learning how to make a good visualization in Tableau while making a story telling of the subject.

### Improvements
- Improve the Tableau presentation;
